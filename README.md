## 📦 E-Commerce Delivery Time Prediction (Linear Regression)
---

This project predicts **estimated delivery time (in hours)** for e-commerce orders using **Linear Regression** based on:
- 📏 Distance (km)
- 📦 Number of packages

It demonstrates a complete **Machine Learning workflow**:
data creation → preprocessing → model training → evaluation → real-time prediction.

---

## 🚀 Features
- Uses **Linear Regression** from `scikit-learn`
- Train-test split for model validation
- Evaluation using:
  - MAE (Mean Absolute Error)
  - MSE (Mean Squared Error)
  - RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)
  - R² Score
- Predicts delivery time for a new order

---

## 🧠 Technologies Used
- Python 
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
